Stack Fertilizer Tanks for USI Life Support

**Description**

Three stack tanks containing Fertilizer for USI Life Support. (1.25m, 2.5m, and 3.75m) They are copies of the Supply tanks that come with USI Life Support and hold the same volume of Fertilizer as the others hold Supplies. The Mulch storage has been removed from these. See screenshot below.

**Download**

Copy USIFertilizerTanks folder into \KerbalSpaceProgram\GameData.

RoverDude gets 99% of the credit for this work. All I've done here is change the part configs and adjust the original texture to make these Fertilizer tanks look distinct from the Supply tanks.
